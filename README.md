a culturally neutral pattern recognition game on web3

How to play:

1. Choose a seed - the seed determines a pseudo random board, allowing friends to play on the same board asynchronously - domain/play/seed/target card
2. Find your target card - you must look for the same pattern and orientation of colors on the board
3. Collect 10 points - once you have reached a total of 10 points you can claim the board as the winner and recieve it as a tradable nft
